Check Your Understanding: 

1) (Within a Github action that runs whenever code is pushed): This provides immediate feedback on every change. If anything breaks, the error is caught before the code is merged. It is also more reliable than running the tests manually, which is a process that is prone to human error.  

2) No. A simple unit test is enough to test a function's output. 


3) Navigation mode analyzes the page immediately after it loads and measures performance. While Snapshot mode freezes the DOM in its current state to catch accessibility issues. 


4) 
1. Add a viewport meta tag <meta name="viewport"> with width or initial-scale.
2. Resize and compress the product images
3. Serve images in next-gen formats and preload the LCP image
